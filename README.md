## MDDN 242 2023 Assignment 2

"I settled on the name 'ArcBlock' for my project.

Initially, I was uncertain about the design direction I should take. You could say I experienced a creative block, a bit of an 'art(c) block,' if you will. Ha ha haaaaa... :|

My aim was to craft something that struck a balance between simplicity and intrigue, and I believe I have successfully achieved that goal. My approach involved the utilization of two arcs and two rectangles to fashion an entire alphabet. I did have some initial doubts about my choice of colors, but I now feel they harmonize nicely with my alphabet design.

Each letter I've created is constructed using a combination of two arcs and two fixed-size rectangles. To achieve the desired letter shapes, I altered the angle of the arcs while keeping the rectangles consistent in size. It's worth noting that the height and x position of the blue rectangles vary depending on the specific letters, such as 'h' and 'l,' among others.

In total, my code employs a set of 15 parameters to bring this project to life."



The fifteen parameters per letter:
  * `size` : size of letters
* `rectX1` : x pos of first rectangle 
 * `rectY1`: y pos of first rectangle 
 * `rectX2`: x pos of second rectangle 
 * `rectY2`: y pos of second rectangle 
 * `arcX1`: x pos of first arc 
 * `arcY1` : y pos of first arc
 * `arcX2`  : x pos of second arc 
 * `arcY2` : y pos of second arc  
  * `start`: start angle of first arc
 * `stop`: stop angle of first arc
 * `start1` : start angle of second arc
 * `stop1`: stop angle of second arc
 * `sizewd`: width of blue rect
 * `sizeht`: height of blue rect
